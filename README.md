# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

First Assignment of the JohnHopkins Web Developer Course on August,2020.

One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it to either meet a certain set of standards 
or implement a new technology. Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses, ensuring that people with disabilities 
or socio-economic restrictions have access to their website, and helping them avoid litigation.

The website has been updated to meet the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

## Features

To meet Web Content Accessibility GuideLines (WCAG), following updates were made to the original code :

  * #### updated code with Semantics Elements
  
    Semantic Elements gives meaning to its content. The search engine uses this information to correctly index the page using the web crawler.
    Use of the semantic elements can increase the webiste ranking.
    
  * #### updated <img> with the alt attribute as per the WCAG 2.1
  
    Alt attribute provides description about the image incase the image is not loaded. When this happens, the Image is replaced with text inside t
    he "alt"attribute. The screen reader provides descrption to people with disability using the alt attribute. As per the WCAG 2.1 , Images used
    for design purpose only should have an empty alt attribute.
    
  * #### Checked for borken links and fixed them
    
    Websites have many links to other webiste and also to various parts of its own site. We should always check for borken links so that the users 
    are not using old information. Some links might expire and be replaced with inappropriate content. 
    
    For example, Site A might be bought and its content might be changed to steal users information. We should check all links as a precaution.
    
   * #### Indentation and comments - Google Html/Css Style Guide
     Website is managed by multiple developers over the lifetime of the website. Always keep the code base clean and provide proper comments. [Google's 
     Html/Css Style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html) was followed to provide proper indentation and comments.
    
   * #### W3C HTML validator and W3C CSS validator
   
     Validated the HTML and CSS code as per W3C guidelines.
     
     [W3C HTML/MARKUP Validator](https://validator.w3.org)
     
     [W3C CSS Validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
